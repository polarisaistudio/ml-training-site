## Why Cover Letters Matter

**The Truth About Cover Letters:**
- **70% of hiring managers** read cover letters when included
- **At competitive companies**, cover letters differentiate similar candidates
- **Especially important for:**
  - Career changers (explaining transition)
  - Candidates without traditional ML background
  - Startups and smaller companies (culture fit matters)
  - Research positions (demonstrating specific interest)

**When to Skip:**
- Application explicitly says "no cover letter"
- High-volume job boards where it's not read
- Referrals (your referrer is your cover letter)

**Key Principle:** 
A great cover letter doesn't just repeat your resume—it tells the story of **why you + this company = perfect fit**.
